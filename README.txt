NAME: Gabriel Clark

TIME: 
	Part 1: 5 hours
	Part 2: 20 min

HARDEST PART:
	The hardest part of this assignment was optimization. I struggled to understand why many functions with similar structure had such different time requirements. I also realized that print statement debugging does not work in haskell because the compiler will optimize away the structure of your program.

STATUS:
	All programs work as expected and run in under 30 seconds on ghci.

COMPARISON TO OUTPUT FILES:
	When compared to the oracle there is no difference.

RESULTS FROM PART 3:
	Part 1: 
		GHCI: (12.90 secs, 9,595,184,016 bytes)
		GHC: 9.42s user 0.08s system 99% cpu 9.501 total
	Part 2: 
		GCHI: (13.94 secs, 9,831,900,472 bytes)	
		GHC: 8.85s user 0.10s system 99% cpu 8.943 total

	Speedup part 1: Speedup from GHCI -> GHC is (12.90/9.41)=1.37%
	Speedup part 2: Speedup from GHCI -> GHC is (13.94/8.85)=1.58%
